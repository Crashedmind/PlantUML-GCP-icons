# Generating the PlantUML Icons for GCP
The tool used to generate this icon set is based on https://github.com/awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml (where modification of the script is permitted per the license).
The script is made generic to be able to process other icon sets.

See symbols.md for a list of all the icons with associated image.
